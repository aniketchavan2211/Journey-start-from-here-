## JavaScript

### Introduction

 **Javascript** is flexiable language that powers dynamic websities and apps.

 JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
 language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has
 dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
 first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
 event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
 It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
 with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures
 , and the Document Object Model (DOM).

 **ECMAscript** is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the
 interoperability of web pages across different web browsers.

 ECMA-262 or the ECMAScript Language Specification defines the
 ECMAScript Language, or just ECMAScript. ECMA-262 only
 specifies language syntax and semantics of the core API, such
 as Array, Function, and globalThis, while valid implementations
 of JavaScript add their own functionality like input/output or
 file system handling.

### Comments

 JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code,
 and to make it more readable.

 JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution,
 when testing alternative code.

#### Single-line Comment

 Single line comments start with `//`.

 Any text between `//` and the end of the line will be ignored
 by JavaScript (will not be executed).


 ```js
 // This is Comment
 ```
#### Mutli-line Comments

 Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

 Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by JavaScript.

 ```js
 /*
 This
 is
 multi-line
 comments
 */
 ```

### Variables and Types 

Variables are like containers we can store values in them,and use any time need.

```
var variable_name = "value"
var  name = "Alex"
```

To define variable `var` keyword is use.
`name` is variable name `=` is to assigned a variable a name
`"Alex"` is a value of name variable.
texts and numbers enclosed with double quotes `""` are
strings.

to assigned variable a number
```js
var age = 18 
```
now, To define varaibles we use,

- `let`
- `const`

`let` keyword is use when we need to update or change value of variable .

```javascript
let name = "Alex";
name = "Alexa";
```

to update variable don't use `let` keyword again
it will throw an error.

What if you don't want to change values of variables.
`const` keyword is use, means constant never change/update variable values.

javascript is case-sensitive language. `NAME` and `name`
is different.

```
const age = 1;
```
