## JavaScript

### Introduction

 **Javascript** is flexiable language that powers dynamic websities and apps.

 JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
 language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has
 dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
 first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
 event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
 It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
 with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures
 , and the Document Object Model (DOM).

 **ECMAscript** is a JavaScript standard meant to ensure the
 interoperability of web pages across different web browsers.

 ECMA-262 or the ECMAScript Language Specification defines the
 ECMAScript Language, or just ECMAScript. ECMA-262 only
 specifies language syntax and semantics of the core API, such
 as Array, Function, and globalThis, while valid implementations
 of JavaScript add their own functionality like input/output or
 file system handling.

### Comments

 JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code,
 and to make it more readable.

 JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution,
 when testing alternative code.

#### Single-line Comment

 Single line comments start with `//`.

 Any text between `//` and the end of the line will be ignored
 by JavaScript (will not be executed).


 ```js
 // This is Comment
 ```
#### Mutli-line Comments

 Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

 Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by JavaScript.

 ```js
 /*
 This
 is
 multi-line
 comments
 */
 ```
