i the internet. Also called as TCP/IP suit. Network Protocol
suit for communicating over TCP.

and outgoing data transfer.

- Firewall :- It is a part of network security, Monitor internet
traffic within network and outside of the network.

- IDS :- Intrusion Detection system, used to monitor data traffic
and detect unwanted packets.

- IPS :- Intrusion Prevention system, Monitor as well as
prevent the packets.

- Sniffing :- is context of network security, corresponding
to theft or interception of data by capturing the network 
traffic using a packet sniffer.

- Spoofing :- network security, a spoofing attack is a situation
i which a person or program successfully identifiles as another
by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.

- Data Aggregation :- is the compiling of information
from database with intent to prepare combined datasets for data processing.

- Exfilterate :- occurs when malware and/or a malicious actor
comes out an unauthorized data transfer from a computer. It 
is also commonly called data extrusion or data exportation.
Data exfiltration is also considered a form of data theft.

- Ethical Hackers / White Hat Hackers :- is an ethical security hacker.[1] Ethical hacking is a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing.

- Grey Hat Hackers :- is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but usually does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.

- Black Hat Hackers :- is a hacker who violates computer security for their own personal profit or out of malice.

- Elite hacker :- A social status among hackers, elite is used to describe the most skilled. Newly discovered exploits circulate among these hackers. Elite groups such as Masters of Deception conferred a kind of credibility on their members.

- Red Hat Hackers :- A red hat hacker is a hacker who takes aggressive steps to stop black hat hackers. While red hat hackers are not inherently evil, they do everything they can to stop the bad guys, including taking matters into their own hands.

- Blue Hat Hackers :- These hackers don’t necessarily care about money or fame. They hack to take personal revenge for a real — or perceived — sleight from a person, employer, institution, or government. Blue hat hackers use malware and deploy various cyber attacks on their enemies’ servers/networks to cause harm to their data, websites, or devices.

- Noobs / Green Hat Hackers :- Green hat hackers are the newest kids on the block who are just starting to learn the craft. They don’t have a clear motivation at the stage they are in (i.e., they can either become a black or a white hat hacker). As has been said, they don’t intentionally want to cause harm but may do so. And since they don’t know that much yet about hacking, they may not be able to fix the damage they caused.

- Cracker :- Crackers are kind of bad people who break or violate the system or a computer remotely with bad intentions to harm the data and steal it. Crackers destroy data by gaining unauthorized access to the network. 

- Script Kidde :- is a relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs, such as a web shell, developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites, according to the programming and hacking cultures.

- Phreakers :- is someone who breaks into the telephone network illegally, typically to make free long-distance phone

- Nation State Sponsored Hacker :- Nation state hackers are group of hackers that are sponsored by government for any purpose. The purpose might include gaining illicit access to other nation's data.

- Hackivist :- a person who gains unauthorized access to computer files or networks in order to further social or political ends.

- Social Engineer :- a person who uses deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information that may be used for fraudulent purposes.

- Malicious Insider or Whileblower :- is a person, often an employee, who reveals information about activity within a private or public organization that is deemed illegal, immoral, illicit, unsafe or fraudulent.

- Suicide Hackers :- Suicide hackers are individuals who aim to bring down critical infrastructure for a “cause” and are not worried about facing jail terms or any other kind of punishment. They are similar to suicide bombers, who sacrifice their life for an attack and are thus not concerned with the consequences of their actions.

- Neophyte :- A neophyte ("newbie", or "noob") is someone who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology and hacking.

- Red team :-  plays the role of the attacker by trying to find vulnerabilities and break through cybersecurity defenses.
- Blue team :- defends against attacks and responds to incidents when they occur. 


- Information Gathering / Reconnaissance :- Information Gathering 
means gathering different kinds of information
about the target. It is basically, the first 
step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, 
where the penetration testers or hackers 
(both black hat or white hat) tries to gather 
all the information about the target, in order
to use it for Hacking.

- Scaning :- This phase includes the usage of 
tools like dialers, port scanners, network 
mappers, sweepers, and vulnerability scanners
to scan data.

- Gaining Access :- This phase is where an 
attacker breaks into the system/network using
various tools or methods. After entering 
into a system, he has to increase his 
privilege to administrator level so he can 
install an application he needs or modify 
data or hide data.

- Maintaining Access :- Hacker may just hack
the system to show it was vulnerable or he 
can be so mischievous that he wants to 
maintain or persist the connection in 
the background without the knowledge of the 
user. This can be done using Trojans, 
Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is 
to maintain the access to the target until he 
finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish 
in that target.

- Clearing Tracks :- An intelligent hacker 
always clears all evidence so that in the 
later point of time, no one will find any 
traces leading to him. This involves 
modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of 
Logs, modifying registry values and 
uninstalling all applications he used and 
deleting all folders he created.
