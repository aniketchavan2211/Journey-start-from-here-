## Terminologies

- Attack :- Action with malicious intention.

- Authentication :- It is a process of identifying the person
or system with usersname and password.

- Backdoor :- Trapdoor, used to gain unauthorized access to 
computer or network.(how programmer may bypass security steps
without permission).

- Buffer :- Temporarily data storage. While data is placed to one
place to another.

- Cipher :- It is a process to cover the data into code or encrypt
algorithm techniques.

- Cryptography :- It is the science and art of protecting the
privacy of the information by encrypting into a secret code.
So only authorised person can view or read the infomation.

- Encryption :- Process of converting plain text into cipher 
text.

- Decryption :- Process of converting cipher text into plain
text.

- Exploit :- To take an advantage of the weakness of the system.

- Hash Value :- It is a result of applying cryptographic hash 
function to data.

- Malware :- Malicious software.it is used to damage computer
system and network and steal the data from that infected system.

- Threat :- It is a possible damger that might exploit a vulnerability 
to violates security protocols.

- Computer security :- To protect the computer system and the data
which is stored in the system.

- Cybersecurity :- It is process of protecting data, system
and networs against cyber attack.

- Infomation Security :- It is a process to protect infomation
and information system from threats through security control
to reach C.I.A. (Confidential, Integrity, Availability).

- Vulnerability :- The potential to harm or loss.

- Exposure :- Risk property exit.

- Resistance :- Action taken to prevent.

- Resilence :- Ability to recover root state.

- Confidentiality :- Limits access to infomation or restrictions
on information access.

- Integrity :- Assurance that the infomation is accurate.

- Availability :- Definite and reliable access by authorized
people.

- Cryptanalysis :- Studying cryptographic system to find weakness
of the cryptographic algorithm and decipher the cipher text
without knowing secret key.

- Authentication :- It is used to identify users.

- Authorization :- It is process to enforcing policies to
determine what type of services can be use by user.

- Accounting :- It manages user consumed resources during access.
It includes amount of data user used and sent login session
time.

- Bug :- It is also called as an error.

- Loophole :- Prpgramming gap through which exploit can be access.

- Key :- It is used to decode encoding things.

- Public key :- It is used to encrypt the data.

- Protocol :- Set of rules or guidelines for communicating
i the internet. Also called as TCP/IP suit. Network Protocol
suit for communicating over TCP.

- Hash Fucntion :- Used to convert plain text into cipher text.

- Port :- End point of communication to handle many incoming
and outgoing data transfer.

- Flags :- Provide usefull service in the process.

- Firewall :- It is a part of network security, Monitor internet
traffic within network and outside of the network.

- IDS :- Intrusion Detection system, used to monitor data traffic
and detect unwanted packets.

- IPS :- Intrusion Prevention system, Monitor as well as
prevent the packets.

- Sniffing :- is context of network security, corresponding
to theft or interception of data by capturing the network 
traffic using a packet sniffer.

- Spoofing :- network security, a spoofing attack is a situation
i which a person or program successfully identifiles as another
by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.

- Data Aggregation :- is the compiling of information
from database with intent to prepare combined datasets for data processing.

- Exfilterate :- occurs when malware and/or a malicious actor
comes out an unauthorized data transfer from a computer. It 
is also commonly called data extrusion or data exportation.
Data exfiltration is also considered a form of data theft.
