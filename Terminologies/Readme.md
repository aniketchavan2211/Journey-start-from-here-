## Terminologies

- Attack :- Action with malicious intention.

- Authentication :- It is a process of identifying the person
or system with usersname and password.

- Backdoor :- Trapdoor, used to gain unauthorized access to 
computer or network.(how programmer may bypass security steps
without permission).

- Buffer :- Temporarily data storage. While data is placed to one
place to another.

- Cipher :- It is a process to cover the data into code or encrypt
algorithm techniques.

- Cryptography :- It is the science and art of protecting the
privacy of the information by encrypting into a secret code.
So only authorised person can view or read the infomation.

- Encryption :- Process of converting plain text into cipher 
text.

- Decryption :- Process of converting cipher text into plain
text.

- Exploit :- To take an advantage of the weakness of the system.

- Hash Value :- It is a result of applying cryptographic hash 
function to data.

- Malware :- Malicious software.it is used to damage computer
system and network and steal the data from that infected system.

- Threat :- It is a possible damger that might exploit a vulnerability 
to violates security protocols.

- Computer security :- To protect the computer system and the data
which is stored in the system.

- Cybersecurity :- It is process of protecting data, system
and networs against cyber attack.

- Infomation Security :- It is a process to protect infomation
and information system from threats through security control
to reach C.I.A. (Confidential, Integrity, Availability).

- Vulnerability :- The potential to harm or loss.

- Exposure :- Risk property exit.

- Resistance :- Action taken to prevent.

- Resilence :- Ability to recover root state.

- Confidentiality :- Limits access to infomation or restrictions
on information access.

- Integrity :- Assurance that the infomation is accurate.

- Availability :- Definite and reliable access by authorized
people.

- Cryptanalysis :- Studying cryptographic system to find weakness
of the cryptographic algorithm and decipher the cipher text
without knowing secret key.

- Authentication :- It is used to identify users.

- Authorization :- It is process to enforcing policies to
determine what type of services can be use by user.

- Accounting :- It manages user consumed resources during access.
It includes amount of data user used and sent login session
time.

- Bug :- It is also called as an error.

- Loophole :- Prpgramming gap through which exploit can be access.

- Key :- It is used to decode encoding things.

- Public key :- It is used to encrypt the data.

- Protocol :- Set of rules or guidelines for communicating
i the internet. Also called as TCP/IP suit. Network Protocol
suit for communicating over TCP.

- Hash Fucntion :- Used to convert plain text into cipher text.

- Port :- End point of communication to handle many incoming
and outgoing data transfer.

- Flags :- Provide usefull service in the process.

- Firewall :- It is a part of network security, Monitor internet
traffic within network and outside of the network.

- IDS :- Intrusion Detection system, used to monitor data traffic
and detect unwanted packets.

- IPS :- Intrusion Prevention system, Monitor as well as
prevent the packets.

- Sniffing :- is context of network security, corresponding
to theft or interception of data by capturing the network 
traffic using a packet sniffer.

- Spoofing :- network security, a spoofing attack is a situation
i which a person or program successfully identifiles as another
by falsifying data, to gain an illegitimate advantage.

- Data Aggregation :- is the compiling of information
from database with intent to prepare combined datasets for data processing.

- Exfilterate :- occurs when malware and/or a malicious actor
comes out an unauthorized data transfer from a computer. It 
is also commonly called data extrusion or data exportation.
Data exfiltration is also considered a form of data theft.

- Information Gathering / Reconnaissance :- Information Gathering 
means gathering different kinds of information
about the target. It is basically, the first 
step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, 
where the penetration testers or hackers 
(both black hat or white hat) tries to gather 
all the information about the target, in order
to use it for Hacking.

- Scaning :- This phase includes the usage of 
tools like dialers, port scanners, network 
mappers, sweepers, and vulnerability scanners
to scan data.

- Gaining Access :- This phase is where an 
attacker breaks into the system/network using
various tools or methods. After entering 
into a system, he has to increase his 
privilege to administrator level so he can 
install an application he needs or modify 
data or hide data.

- Maintaining Access :- Hacker may just hack
the system to show it was vulnerable or he 
can be so mischievous that he wants to 
maintain or persist the connection in 
the background without the knowledge of the 
user. This can be done using Trojans, 
Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is 
to maintain the access to the target until he 
finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish 
in that target.

- Clearing Tracks :- An intelligent hacker 
always clears all evidence so that in the 
later point of time, no one will find any 
traces leading to him. This involves 
modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of 
Logs, modifying registry values and 
uninstalling all applications he used and 
deleting all folders he created.
