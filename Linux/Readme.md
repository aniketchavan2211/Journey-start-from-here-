## What is Unix?

  Unix is a portable, multitasking, multiuser, time-sharing
  operating system OS).

  The Unix opearting system is a set of programs that act as a
  link between the computer and the user.

  Unix was originally deveploped in 1969 by a group of
  employees at AT&T.

  Unix was first programmed in assembly language but was
  reprogrammed in C in 1973.


# Linux

![linux logo]( https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/Journey-start-from-here/blob/master/Images/linux.png)
 
 Linux is a free, open-source, and community-developed operating
 system.
 
 Linux is one of the few open-source systems where the kernel 
 isrresponsible for establishing the connection between the
 computer hardware and the operating system software.

 Linux is a kernel upon.which many operating system, such as Ubuntu
 and Arch Linux, are built.

 Behind every application, on a computer, there is an operating
 system that allows you to use the hardware.

 In 1991, Linus Torvalds began creating Linux as a hobby.

 While in college, Linus wanted to create a version of the MINIX
 operating system that would be based or Unix principles and
 design. Linus hardware support and licensing have made
 Linux a tremendous success.a
 
 It powers 90% of the world's server and is the basis of Google's
 popular Andriod Operating System.


## Interaction with Linux

  A user can interact with Linux either using a (graphical interface
  or using the command line interface.

  The command line is an interesting beast, and if you're not used
  our before, it can be a bit daunting: Don't worry, with a bit
  of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend.

  What is a Command Line Interface (CLI) A command line, or
  terminal, is a text-based interface to the system. You
  can enter commands by trying them on the keyword and results
  will be returned in the form of text too.

## Why Linux ?

 Although Linux offers high security and stability,
 users initially disliked the interface because
 it was not very user-friendly. But this was 
 not the case for them.

 With regular updates and feedback from users,
 Linux become much more appealing.

 Every supercomputer runs on Linux!, Linux
 runs all 500 of the world's fastest supercomputers.
 It's a default choice when it comes to supercomputers.

 Linux is everywhere!

 There are many reasons why Linux is so popular
 among different fields. Here are a few,

 - **It's Free**:There is no cost for using Linux 
 OS (Desktop or Server distro) and related 
 applications.
 - **More Choice**: You can't beat Linux here.
 There are over 600 Linux distros and about 500
 in active development.

 - **Developers Friend**: Developers love Linux.
 It supports almost all the major programming
 languages you can think of. A rich set of native
 libraries, a powerful and far better Linux 
 terminal than Windows CLI.

 **Linux by design is a Kernel, not a Operating
 System.**

 `Kernel` :
 It is the primary part of an operating system.
 For a system to start working. the kernel is the
 very first part of your operating system that 
 gets loaded into the RAM.

 It is the core interface between a computer's
 hardware and it's process aka application to
 use the hardware.

 **What does an Operating system provide?**
 Operating system come with several tools and 
 service (such as a desktop, a clock, an application
 menu, and more). It includes the kernel as well
 as part of it.

 There are many companies like Red Hat, Cononical
 , SuSE which provide support for their customized
 Linux kernel-based operating systems.

 Let's take a look at the top four ways in which 
 you can use Linux to take your business to 
 the next level.

 1. **Portability**: Linux is a portable OS. You can
 run it on any hardware without fear of
 encountering any compatibility, Installation,
 or support issues. The OS supports high-end
 and low-end systems equally well.

 2. **Application Support** :Linux has a software
 repository that allows users to download and 
 install commands in shell or Linux Terminal,
 and it can run Windows applications too.

 3. **Multi-User** :Linux has user spaces, where
 each space has its own data, application, and
 information.
 Multiple users can access the same Linux machine
 at the same time, a feature that not even Windows 
 or macOS can boost.

 4. **Adaptable**: Since Linux is open source,
 you can tweak the system as you please, and 
 since it's free, you can use any type of hardware.

 Like any other operating system, Linux has a 
 set of software that functions differently.
 The components are :

 1. **Kernel** : The kernel is the heart of this 
 Operating Systems. It manages the communication
 between the software and the devices.

 2. **System Tools** : Linux has a set of system 
 tools that are exclusive to certain functions.
 These simple commands are free to everyone.

 3. **Shell** : The shell is the utility that
 processes your requests. Basically, when you type in a command, the 
 shell interprets the command and calls the 
 program that you want.

 4. **Files and Directories** : In Linux, all files
 are organised into directories. Directories
 can have nested directories inside them, wich
 in turn have their own files, and so on, In 
 this way, an entire file system can be made
 up of hierarchical directories.

 Linux is the prefect choice when you need
 to run highly available, reliable, and critical
 workloads in a cloud computing environment.
 Wide support for devices, varied use cases,
 and systems.
