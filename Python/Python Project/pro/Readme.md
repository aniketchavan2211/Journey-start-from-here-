### Types and Comparison

#### Comparing Dataset Entries

 Let's use our knowledge about booleans and companies to
 compare the data of two students from a collection of grade
 submission.

### Conditional Statements

#### User Database

 Let's use a condition to check if a user has been added
 to a database. Here's a look at the final code.

 Snippet: [User Database](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/User_Database.py)

#### Finding Outlier

 Let's use conditional to help create code that checks for
 outliers in some data.

#### Collecting Data Points

 Let's create a program to check if there are enough data
 points within a dataset. Here's a peek at the finished code.

 Snippet: [Collecting Data Points](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Collecting_Data_Points.py)

### Loops

#### Coupon Generator

 Let's use a for loop to speed up the process of creating
 multiple discount coupon codes.

 Snippet: [Coupon Generator](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Coupons_Generator.py)

### Organizing Data

#### Highest Score

 Let's create some code that helps an arcade machine find
 the highest score from a list of scores without the help
 `max()`.

 Snippet: [Highest Score](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Highest_Score.py)

### Using String

#### Tip Calculator

 Let's use your knowledge about data types and formatted
 string to create a tip calculator for your next evening
 out 1.

 Snippet: [Tip Calculator](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/594bdb7fcf105456ad01d64940474e8995504ba2/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Tip_Calculator.py)

### Functions

#### Calculator

 Let's create a simple calculator that can add, substracts
 , and multiply numbers.

 Snippet: [Calculator.py](https://github.com/aniketchavan2211/aniketchavan2211/blob/1682e1f5da4cb1f5e8493d4ff9cd13a1f8404aeb/Python/Python%20Project/pro/Calculator.py)
