- Ethical Hackers / White Hat Hackers :- is an ethical security hacker.[1] Ethical hacking is a term meant to imply a broader category than just penetration testing.

- Grey Hat Hackers :- is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but usually does not have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.

- Black Hat Hackers :- is a hacker who violates computer security for their own personal profit or out of malice.

- Elite hacker :- A social status among hackers, elite is used to describe the most skilled. Newly discovered exploits circulate among these hackers. Elite groups such as Masters of Deception conferred a kind of credibility on their members.

- Red Hat Hackers :- A red hat hacker is a hacker who takes aggressive steps to stop black hat hackers. While red hat hackers are not inherently evil, they do everything they can to stop the bad guys, including taking matters into their own hands.

- Blue Hat Hackers :- These hackers don’t necessarily care about money or fame. They hack to take personal revenge for a real — or perceived — sleight from a person, employer, institution, or government. Blue hat hackers use malware and deploy various cyber attacks on their enemies’ servers/networks to cause harm to their data, websites, or devices.

- Noobs / Green Hat Hackers :- Green hat hackers are the newest kids on the block who are just starting to learn the craft. They don’t have a clear motivation at the stage they are in (i.e., they can either become a black or a white hat hacker). As has been said, they don’t intentionally want to cause harm but may do so. And since they don’t know that much yet about hacking, they may not be able to fix the damage they caused.

- Cracker :- Crackers are kind of bad people who break or violate the system or a computer remotely with bad intentions to harm the data and steal it. Crackers destroy data by gaining unauthorized access to the network. 

- Script Kidde :- is a relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts or programs, such as a web shell, developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and deface websites, according to the programming and hacking cultures.

- Phreakers :- is someone who breaks into the telephone network illegally, typically to make free long-distance phone

- Malicious Insider or Whileblower :- is a person, often an employee, who reveals information about activity within a private or public organization that is deemed illegal, immoral, illicit, unsafe or fraudulent.

- Suicide Hackers :- Suicide hackers are individuals who aim to bring down critical infrastructure for a “cause” and are not worried about facing jail terms or any other kind of punishment. They are similar to suicide bombers, who sacrifice their life for an attack and are thus not concerned with the consequences of their actions.

- Neophyte :- A neophyte ("newbie", or "noob") is someone who is new to hacking or phreaking and has almost no knowledge or experience of the workings of technology and hacking.

- Red team :-  plays the role of the attacker by trying to find vulnerabilities and break through cybersecurity defenses.
- Blue team :- defends against attacks and responds to incidents when they occur. 


- Information Gathering / Reconnaissance :- Information Gathering 
means gathering different kinds of information
about the target. It is basically, the first 
step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, 
where the penetration testers or hackers 
(both black hat or white hat) tries to gather 
all the information about the target, in order
to use it for Hacking.

- Scaning :- This phase includes the usage of 
tools like dialers, port scanners, network 
mappers, sweepers, and vulnerability scanners
to scan data.

- Gaining Access :- This phase is where an 
attacker breaks into the system/network using
various tools or methods. After entering 
into a system, he has to increase his 
privilege to administrator level so he can 
install an application he needs or modify 
data or hide data.

- Maintaining Access :- Hacker may just hack
the system to show it was vulnerable or he 
can be so mischievous that he wants to 
maintain or persist the connection in 
the background without the knowledge of the 
user. This can be done using Trojans, 
Rootkits or other malicious files. The aim is 
to maintain the access to the target until he 
finishes the tasks he planned to accomplish 
in that target.

- Clearing Tracks :- An intelligent hacker 
always clears all evidence so that in the 
later point of time, no one will find any 
traces leading to him. This involves 
modifying/corrupting/deleting the values of 
Logs, modifying registry values and 
uninstalling all applications he used and 
deleting all folders he created.

## Attacks 

- **Malware** :- Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive users access to information or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer security and privacy.
- **Virus** :- Computer Virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus, a metaphor derived from biological viruses.
- **Trojan**:- Trojan horse is any malware that misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.
- **Worm** :- Computer Worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.[1] It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behavior will continue.
- **Backdoor Programs** :- Backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a "homunculus computer" —a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology).
- **Phishing** :- Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim's infrastructure like ransomware. 
- **MiTM** :- man-in-the-middle, monster-in-the-middle, machine-in-the-middle, monkey-in-the-middle, meddler-in-the-middle, manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM), person-in-the-middle (PITM) or adversary-in-the-middle[8] (AiTM) attack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe that they are directly communicating with each other, as the attacker has inserted themselves between the two parties.
- **DoS** :- Denial-of-service (DoS) attack floods a server with traffic, making a website or resource unavailable.
- **DDoS** :- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a DoS attack that uses multiple computers or machines to flood a targeted resource.
- **XSS** :- Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that can be found in some web applications. XSS attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. 
- **SQL Injection** :- SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).
- **Botnet Attack** :- Botnet is a group of Internet-connected devices, each of which runs one or more bots. Botnets can be used to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, steal data,[1] send spam, and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control (C&C) software.
- **Password Attack** :- Password attacks involve exploiting a broken authorization vulnerability in the system combined with automatic password attack tools that speed up the guessing and cracking of passwords. 
- **Key logger Attack** :- Keylogger is an insidious form of spyware. You enter sensitive data onto your keyboard, believing nobody is watching. In fact, keylogging software is hard at work logging everything that you type.
- **Eavesdropping Atatck** :- Eavesdropping attack, also known as a sniffing or snooping attack, is a theft of information as it is transmitted over a network by a computer, smartphone, or another connected device.
- **Shouder Surfing** :- shoulder surfing is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder.
- **Crytpjacking** :- Cryptojacking is the act of hijacking a computer to mine cryptocurrencies against the users will, through websites, or while the user is unaware.
- **Social Engineering Attack** :- Social Engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
- **Brute-force Attack** :- Brute-Force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.
- **Dictionary Attack** :- Dictionary Attack is an attack using a restricted subset of a keyspace to defeat a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase, sometimes trying thousands or millions of likely possibilities[1] often obtained from lists of past security breaches.
- **Rainbow Table Attack** :- Rainbow Table partitions a function, whose domain is a set of values and whose codomain is a set of keys derived from those values, into chains such that each chain is an alternating sequence of values and keys, followed by a final value.
- **Buffer Overflow** :-  Buffer Overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations.
- **Code Injection** :- Code injection is the exploitation of a computer bug that is caused by processing invalid data. The injection is used by an attacker to introduce (or "inject") code into a vulnerable computer program and change the course of execution. The result of successful code injection can be disastrous, for example, by allowing computer viruses or computer worms to propagate.
- **Session Hijacking** :- Session hijacking, sometimes also known as cookie hijacking, is the exploitation of a valid computer session—sometimes also called a session key—to gain unauthorized access to information or services in a computer system.
- **Obfuscation** :- Obfuscation means to make something difficult to understand. Programming code is often obfuscated to protect intellectual property or trade secrets, and to prevent an attacker from reverse engineering a proprietary software program.
- **LDAP injection** :- LDAP injection is a code injection technique used to exploit web applications which could reveal sensitive user information or modify information represented in the LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) data stores.[1][2][3] LDAP injection exploits a security vulnerability in an application by manipulating input parameters passed to internal search, add or modify functions. When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it is possible for an attacker to modify an LDAP statement.

## Unified Kill Chain(UKC)

### CYCLE 1: In

- Reconnaissance: The attacker performs research on the target using publicly available information.
- Weaponisation: Setting up the needed infrastructure to host the command and control centre (C2) is crucial in executing attacks.
- Delivery: Payloads are malicious instruments delivered to the target through numerous means, such as email phishing and supply chain attacks.
- Social Engineering: The attacker will trick their target into performing untrusted and unsafe action against the payload they just delivered, often making their message appear to come from a trusted in-house source.
- Exploitation: If the attacker finds an existing vulnerability, a software or hardware weakness, in the network assets, they may use this to trigger their payload.
- Persistence: The attacker will leave behind a fallback presence on the network or asset to make sure they have a point of access to their target.
- Defence Evasion: The attacker must remain anonymous throughout their exploits by disabling and avoiding any security defence mechanisms enabled, including deleting evidence of their presence.
- Command & Control: Remember the infrastructure that the attacker prepared? A communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker’s infrastructure is established across the internet.

### Cycle 2: Through

- Pivoting: Remember the system that the attacker may use for persistence? This system will become the attack launchpad for other systems in the network.
- Discovery: The attacker will seek to gather as much information about the compromised system, such as available users and data. Alternatively, they may remotely discover vulnerabilities and assets within the network. This opens the way for the next phase.
- Privilege Escalation: Restricted access prevents the attacker from executing their mission. Therefore, they will seek higher privileges on the compromised systems by exploiting identified vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- Execution: With elevated privileges, malicious code may be downloaded and executed to extract sensitive information or cause further havoc on the system.
- Credential Access: Part of the extracted sensitive information would include login credentials stored in the hard disk or memory. This provides the attacker with more firepower for their attacks.
- Lateral Movement: Using the extracted credentials, the attacker may move around different systems or data storages within the network, for example, within a single department.

### Cycle 3:Out

- Collection: After finding the jackpot of data and information, the attacker will seek to aggregate all they need. By doing so, the assets’ confidentiality would be compromised entirely, especially when dealing with trade secrets and financial or personally identifiable information (PII) that is to be secured.
- Exfiltration: The attacker must get his loot out of the network. Various techniques may be used to ensure they have achieved their objectives without triggering suspicion.
- Impact: When compromising the availability or integrity of an asset or information, the attacker will use all the acquired privileges to manipulate, interrupt and sabotage. Imagine the reputation, financial and social damage an organisation would have to recover from.
- Objectives: Attackers may have other goals to achieve that may affect the social or technical landscape that their targets operate within. Defining and understanding these objectives tends to help security teams familiarise themselves with adversarial attack tools and conduct risk assessments to defend their assets
