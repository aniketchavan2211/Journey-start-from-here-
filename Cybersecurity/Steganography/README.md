## Steganography

Steganography is the art and science of embedding secret 
messages in a cover message in such way that no one, apart
from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence te message.

### Types of Steganography 

1. Pure steganography
2. Secret-key steganography
3. Public-key steganography

#### Pure steganography

It does not require the exchange of ciphers such as stego-key
, but the sender and receiver must have access to embedding and 
extracting algorithms.


#### Secret-key Steganography

This method uses a key to embed the secret message into the cover.

The key is only known to the sender and the receiver and
is known prior to communication. Also the key should be
exchanged in a secure medium.

#### Public-key Steganography

It uses two keys, the public key stored in a public database 
and is used for the embedding process and the secret key 
is known only to communication parties and is used to 
reconstruct the original message.
